# Stopwatch-Timer
In this project, a stopwatch (timer) is created using HTML, CSS &amp; some JavaScript code. This stopwatch only resets the time when the page is reloaded or refreshed. This project perfectly defines the use and working of JavaScript variables &amp; functions. A small portion of CSS is used in creativity.
